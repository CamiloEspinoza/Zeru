# Blue-green upstreams are managed by deploy.sh via a volume-mounted conf file.
# The upstream file is written to /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstream/zeru-upstream.conf
# and uses Docker container names instead of host ports. Example content:
#
#   upstream zeru_api { server zeru-api-blue:3000; }
#   upstream zeru_web { server zeru-web-blue:3000; }
