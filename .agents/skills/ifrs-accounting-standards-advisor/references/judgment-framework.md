## 1) Purpose and mindset

The goal is not just to reach an answer, but to produce an answer that is:
- technically grounded,
- transparent about assumptions,
- auditable,
- appropriately cautious for the stakes.

When evidence is weak or facts are incomplete, produce a structured preliminary view rather than false certainty.

## 2) Judgment protocol (apply explicitly)

For each significant judgment:

### Step 1: Define the judgment decision
State exactly what is being judged.
Examples:
- whether control exists
- whether a contract contains a lease
- lease term including renewal options
- whether development criteria are met
- whether a liability is present obligation vs contingency
- whether classification is equity or liability

### Step 2: Explain why the judgment is necessary
- What standard requirement creates the need for judgment?
- Why cannot the answer be derived mechanically?

### Step 3: Identify outcome-sensitive facts
List the facts that could change the result.
Separate:
- known facts
- assumed facts
- unknown facts

### Step 4: Evaluate support for each plausible view
For each supportable view:
- key supporting facts
- weaknesses / counterarguments
- likely reporting consequences
- disclosure implications

### Step 5: Recommend a view and document boundaries
State the preferred view and:
- why it is preferred
- what could cause reassessment
- what validation is required before final reporting

## 3) Materiality framework (quantitative + qualitative)

Do not rely on one threshold. Assess materiality in context.

### Quantitative considerations (examples)
- size relative to profit, EBITDA, revenue, total assets, equity, or cash flow
- cumulative impact across periods
- volatility introduced by the item
- sensitivity to estimates / assumptions

### Qualitative considerations (often decisive)
- changes a trend, covenant, or key metric
- affects compliance or regulatory focus areas
- changes management compensation metrics
- masks a change in earnings quality
- relates to a strategic transaction (acquisition, financing, restructuring)
- affects segment reporting or stakeholder perception
- involves related parties
- indicates control weakness or inconsistency in policy application

### Practical output rule
Even if an item is quantitatively small, still address:
- correct accounting logic (briefly if immaterial)
- any targeted disclosure or policy implications
- whether aggregation with similar items could become material

## 4) Estimates and uncertainty framework

Use this framework whenever measurement depends on assumptions.

### A. Identify the estimate
Examples:
- discount rate
- expected credit loss assumptions
- variable consideration constraint
- fair value multiple / cash flow projections
- useful life / residual value
- probability-weighted provision outcomes

### B. Identify the method
- historical data model
- market observable inputs
- valuation model
- management forecast
- external specialist valuation
- scenario/probability-weighted estimate

### C. Identify inputs and observability
Classify inputs broadly:
- **Observable** (market-based, contractual, externally verifiable)
- **Partially observable** (market-informed but adjusted)
- **Unobservable / management assumption**

### D. Identify uncertainty and sensitivity
- Which assumptions drive the outcome most?
- What range of reasonable outcomes exists?
- Would a reasonably possible change be material?

### E. Identify reassessment triggers
- new market data
- revised forecasts
- contract modifications
- default experience changes
- legal developments
- post-period events (with IAS 10 analysis)

### Output expectation
For major estimates, explicitly state:
- method
- key assumptions
- evidence quality
- sensitivity / uncertainty
- reassessment triggers

## 5) Evidence quality grading

Use this grading to avoid overconfidence.

### Grade A (Strong)
- Signed contracts / legal documents
- Audited historical data
- Direct market observable inputs
- Approved board/audit committee documents
- Reconciled subledger and source data

### Grade B (Usable but needs corroboration)
- Internal schedules with review evidence
- Management forecasts with historical forecasting accuracy
- Draft contracts near-final
- Third-party data requiring normalization

### Grade C (Weak / preliminary)
- Verbal summaries without documents
- Unreviewed spreadsheets
- “Expected” terms not yet executed
- Incomplete data extracts
- Unsupported assumptions

### How to use the grade
- **A/B evidence** may support a strong or moderate conclusion (depending on judgment complexity)
- **C evidence** generally requires a preliminary conclusion and explicit validation points

## 6) Change classification framework (policy vs estimate vs error)

This classification often changes the reporting outcome materially.

### A. Change in accounting policy
Indications:
- entity changes the principle/basis/convention/rule used for recognition/measurement/presentation
- move to a different acceptable IFRS policy (where permitted)
- new standard adoption changes required policy

Typical consequences:
- often retrospective application (subject to specific IFRS requirements / impracticability)
- expanded disclosures about nature and effect

### B. Change in accounting estimate
Indications:
- new information or new developments refine a measurement input or expected outcome
- no change in underlying accounting principle
Examples:
- useful life, residual value, expected losses, discount rates, forecast assumptions

Typical consequences:
- typically prospective recognition
- estimate-uncertainty disclosures as needed

### C. Correction of prior-period error
Indications:
- omission/misstatement from failure to use or misuse reliable information available when statements were authorized
- mathematical mistakes, oversight, misapplication of accounting policy, fraud impacts

Typical consequences:
- retrospective restatement (subject to impracticability)
- specific disclosures on nature and impact

### Practical protocol
Before drafting JEs or notes, state:
1. classification (policy / estimate / error)
2. reason for classification
3. resulting retrospective/prospective implications
4. disclosure consequences

## 7) Confidence calibration and escalation triggers

### Confidence labels

**High confidence**
- Specific standard directly addresses issue
- Facts are complete and evidenced
- Limited judgment required
- Minimal ambiguity in scope

**Moderate confidence**
- Some assumptions required or multiple standards interact
- Judgment is present but bounded
- Evidence mostly adequate
- Final position depends on targeted validation

**Preliminary**
- Critical facts missing or evidence weak
- Novel/complex structure
- Material judgment unresolved
- Competing views not yet tested

### Escalation triggers (recommend technical accounting review)

Escalate when any of the following apply:
- material impact on earnings, equity, covenants, or capital
- novel or non-routine transaction
- complex multi-standard interactions
- significant valuation uncertainty
- potential regulator/auditor sensitivity
- disagreement among stakeholders on interpretation
- policy change / error correction with restatement implications
- first-time application of major new standard/amendment in a complex fact pattern

## 8) Documentation checklist (for audit-ready reasoning)

For significant issues, include or request:

- [ ] Precise issue statement and requested output
- [ ] Reporting framework and context (period, consolidated/separate, etc.)
- [ ] Fact summary with sources
- [ ] Assumptions clearly separated
- [ ] Standard mapping (primary + supporting)
- [ ] Scope analysis
- [ ] Recognition / measurement / presentation / disclosure conclusions
- [ ] Key judgments and estimates with rationale
- [ ] Evidence quality assessment
- [ ] Alternative views considered (if applicable)
- [ ] Missing facts / validation points
- [ ] Confidence level and escalation recommendation (if needed)
