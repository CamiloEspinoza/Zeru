# IFRS Disclosure Patterns and Checklist Design

Use this reference to generate transaction-specific disclosure checklists instead of generic boilerplate.
This is a **thinking framework**, not a substitute for reading the applicable standards.

## 1) Disclosure design principles

### A. Treat disclosure as part of the accounting conclusion
Do not stop at recognition and measurement.
A correct measurement with incomplete disclosures can still be a reporting failure.

### B. Build from the transaction, then map to standards
Start with what users of financial statements need to understand:
- nature of the transaction
- key terms and economics
- accounting policy applied
- measurement basis and assumptions
- uncertainty and sensitivity
- period movement / impact
- risks and future implications

Then map to the required IFRS disclosure topics.

### C. Distinguish disclosure categories

For each issue, consider:
- **Policy disclosures** (what policy applies and how)
- **Judgments** (significant judgments in applying policies)
- **Estimates/uncertainty** (assumptions, sensitivities)
- **Quantitative line-item impacts**
- **Rollforwards / reconciliations**
- **Risk disclosures**
- **Transition disclosures** (new standards, policy changes, restatements)
- **Entity-specific narrative** (avoid boilerplate)

### D. Materiality shapes depth, not rigor
If immaterial, the output may be shorter.
But still confirm whether any targeted disclosure is needed due to qualitative materiality.

## 2) Universal disclosure checklist skeleton (copy/paste)

Use this skeleton for any material transaction.

## 4) Judgments and estimates disclosure pattern

Use when the issue is highly judgmental, regardless of topic.

### Significant judgments (policy application)
Disclose judgments that materially affect amounts recognized, such as:
- control / significant influence conclusions
- principal vs agent
- lease term
- performance obligation identification
- classification decisions (equity vs liability; current vs non-current)
- CGU identification

Checklist:
- [ ] What judgment was made
- [ ] Why the judgment was necessary
- [ ] What facts/evidence support it
- [ ] What would change the conclusion

### Estimation uncertainty (measurement)
Disclose estimates with significant risk of material adjustment in future periods, such as:
- fair value inputs
- discount rates
- credit losses
- impairment cash flow forecasts
- useful lives / residual values
- provisions and legal outcomes

Checklist:
- [ ] Key estimate and affected balances
- [ ] Methods and assumptions used
- [ ] Degree of uncertainty / sensitivity
- [ ] Expected timing of resolution (if known)

## 5) Control and evidence reminders (internal)

For every disclosure set, confirm:
- amounts tie to subledger/JE and financial statements
- wording matches accounting conclusion and policy
- consistency across notes and management commentary (where relevant)
- prior-period comparatives updated consistently
- assumptions in note disclosures match valuation/impairment models

## 6) Common disclosure failure modes

- Boilerplate note wording that does not describe the actual transaction
- Disclosures that contradict the journal entries or financial statement line items
- Missing judgment disclosures where decisions were clearly judgmental
- Omitted sensitivities on estimation-heavy balances
- Inconsistent terminology across notes (e.g., “contract asset” vs “receivable”)
- Copying prior-year note structure despite changed facts
- Treating disclosure as optional because the monetary amount seems small without considering qualitative materiality
