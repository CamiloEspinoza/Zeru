## 1) Universal minimum fact set (ask first, if missing)

1. What reporting framework applies (Full IFRS, IFRS for SMEs, local GAAP)?
2. What reporting period/date is the analysis for?
3. Is this for consolidated or separate financial statements?
4. What is the transaction/event, in plain language and in contract terms?
5. What amount(s) are involved (quantify the order of magnitude)?
6. What documents exist (signed contract, amendment, invoice, valuation, board approval)?
7. What accounting treatment is currently being used (if any)?
8. Is the user seeking:
   - quick directional view,
   - internal memo,
   - policy draft,
   - JE proposal,
   - audit-ready conclusion?
9. Are there materiality or audit sensitivity concerns already identified?

## 2) Revenue (IFRS 15) questions

Ask only what matters to the issue at hand.

### Impairment / risk / hedging

### IFRS 9 ECL

## 8) Provisions and contingencies (IAS 37) questions

- Is the underlying item recognized in P&L, OCI, or equity?

## 10) Change classification (policy vs estimate vs error) questions

Ask these whenever a user says “we changed”, “we corrected”, or “auditor asked us to revise”.

1. What exactly changed (principle, method, assumption, data, or prior calculation)?
2. Why did it change (new information, new standard, mistake identified, policy choice)?
3. Was reliable information available at the time prior statements were approved?
4. Is the underlying accounting principle changing, or only an input/assumption?
5. Which periods are affected?
6. Has the entity applied this treatment consistently in prior periods?
7. Is there auditor/regulator feedback driving the change?
8. What disclosures and comparative impacts are expected?

## Prompting strategy tips (for agents)

- Start with the universal minimum fact set.
- Ask at most 3–6 high-impact questions at a time.
- Prefer conditional analysis when possible:
  - “If X, then treatment A; if not X, treatment B.”
- Explain why each requested fact matters to the conclusion.
- Do not ask for data that will not change the answer.
