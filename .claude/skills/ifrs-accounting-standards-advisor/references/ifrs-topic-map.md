## 1) Routing principles

- Start with the **economic substance** of the transaction.
- Identify the **unit of account** before selecting the standard.
- Test **scope** before recognition and measurement.
- Separate:
  - measurement rules
  - presentation/classification rules
  - disclosure requirements
- Expect more than one standard to apply:
  - one primary standard
  - several supporting standards (e.g., IFRS 7, IFRS 13, IAS 1, IAS 12, IAS 36)

## 3) Scope traps and boundary checks

Use this list before finalizing.

### Revenue vs financial instrument vs lease vs provision boundaries

- Not every cash inflow contract is IFRS 15 revenue.
- A financing arrangement may be primarily IFRS 9, not IFRS 15.
- A contract can contain a lease plus services (IFRS 16 + IFRS 15 or other guidance).
- Expected losses on contracts may be scoped to a specific standard before IAS 37.

### Business combination vs asset acquisition

This is a high-impact classification choice.
- Test whether acquired set includes inputs + substantive processes + outputs (or output substitutes, depending on fact pattern and standard framework).
- If asset acquisition, acquisition accounting and goodwill rules differ significantly.

### Equity vs liability classification

High-risk error area.
- Legal label (“preferred shares”, “loan note”, “equity contribution”) is not enough.
- Assess contractual obligation to deliver cash/another financial asset and settlement terms.

### Capitalization vs expense

- “Long-term benefit” alone does not guarantee capitalization.
- For intangibles, development capitalization criteria are strict and evidentially demanding.
- For cloud/software arrangements, evaluate rights obtained and service vs asset nature carefully.

### Policy change vs estimate change vs error correction

Another high-risk presentation/disclosure issue.
- Similar operational outcome can have very different reporting consequences.
- Always classify the nature of the change before drafting JE or restatement language.

## 4) Multi-standard issue patterns

Likely standards:
- IFRS 15 (revenue model)
- IFRS 9 (receivable classification and ECL)

Checklist:
1. Identify performance obligations and transaction price under IFRS 15

4. Apply IFRS 9 impairment model
5. Draft disclosures across both standards

### Pattern B: Lease with restoration obligation and impairment indicators

Likely standards:
- IFRS 16

- IAS 36 (impairment)
- IAS 12 / IAS 7

Checklist:
1. Identify lease and lease term
2. Measure lease liability and ROU asset
3. Include restoration cost in asset/provision as applicable
4. Test impairment if indicators exist
5. Address cash flow and disclosure classification

### Pattern C: Acquisition with contingent consideration and identifiable intangibles

Likely standards:
- IFRS 3

- IFRS 7/IFRS 9 (if contingent consideration classified as financial liability)

Checklist:
1. Confirm business combination and acquisition date
2. Identify acquirer and consideration transferred
3. Measure identifiable assets/liabilities at acquisition-date values
4. Classify and measure contingent consideration
5. Determine goodwill/bargain purchase
6. Prepare post-combination measurement and disclosure plan

Likely standards:
- IFRS 9 / IAS 32
- IAS 21
- IFRS 7

4. Map P&L vs OCI vs reserve effects
5. Draft risk and hedge disclosures

## 5) Industry-sensitive areas (be explicit)

Industry affects facts, not the standards hierarchy. Still, ask for context because judgments and disclosures differ.

- **Banking / lending**: ECL staging, model governance, overlays, modification accounting, regulatory metrics interplay
- **Insurance**: IFRS 17 policy sets, coverage units, transition, data systems
- **Real estate / construction**: revenue timing, principal-agent, contract modifications, investment property classification, borrowing costs
- **Technology / SaaS**: revenue bundles, implementation services, capitalization of development costs, cloud arrangements
- **Retail / consumer**: loyalty programs, returns, breakage, lease portfolios, inventory write-downs
- **Agriculture**: biological assets vs inventory, fair value costs to sell, harvest point accounting
- **Extractives / infrastructure**: decommissioning provisions, componentization, impairment, long-term contracts, government grants/concessions
